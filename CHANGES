Version 0.34.4 (2016/05/19)
  Bug fix again… introduced in previous version

Version 0.34.3 (2016/05/18)

Version 0.34.1 (2016/05/14)
  Bug fix in default values for depth bounds

Version 0.34 (2016/05/10)
  NB: changes prefixed with "==>" belows breaks existing code!
  NB: changes prefixed with "-->" belows makes existing code deprecated
  ==> new syntax:
       X<<Y for X is before Y in the linear order
       X<Y fot X is immediatly before Y in the linear order (diff from semantics introduced in 0.32)
  ==> new_syntax for regular expression on label edges:
      NEW: X -[re"__your_regular_expression_here__"]-> Y
      OLD: X -[aux:*]-> Y is not supported anymore
  ==> new_syntax for regular expression on featues:
      NEW: X.feat = re"__your_regular_expression_here__" (no whitespace between re and double quote)
      OLD: X.feat == "__your_regular_expression_here__" introduced in 0.32 is not supported anymore
  --> remove lex_rule keyword: use "rule" instead
  --> add_neighbour is now deprecated and new syntax is introduced for nodes creation:
      add_node X        Create a new node named X wihtout position constraint
      add_node X :> Y   Create a new node named X immediatly after Y
      add_node X :< Y   Create a new node named X immediatly before Y
  * improve search for a sequence:
      1) search for the sequence with the requested name
      2) search for the module with the requested name
      3) select the first sequence defined in the GRS file
  * domain can be declared in a external file
  * add functions Rewrite.set_max_depth_non_det and Rewrite.set_max_depth_det to the library
  * improve error handling
  * change precedence implementation
  * remove useless code

  * move conll handling code into an external library libcaml-conll

Version 0.32 (2016/02/01)
  * extend syntax:
    - syntactic sugar: "A < B" is interpreted as "A.position < B.position"
    - complete pattern with implicit nodes
    - add new constraint with regexp
  * move to ocamlbuild
  * add "node_matching" function for the new "grep" mode

Version 0.31 (2015/11/15)

  * add support for the [-full] mode
  * handling of "*" in pattern edge labels

Version 0.24 (2014/11/24)
  * Changes in the interface:
    - the "loc" type is abstract and exported (changes the libgrew interface)
