Version 0.34 (2016/05/10)
  NB: changes prefixed with "==>" belows breaks existing code!
  NB: changes prefixed with "-->" belows makes existing code deprecated
  ==> new syntax:
       X<<Y for X is before Y in the linear order
       X<Y fot X is immediatly before Y in the linear order (diff from semantics introduced in 0.32)
  ==> new_syntax for regular expression on label edges:
      NEW: X -[re"__your_regular_expression_here__"]-> Y
      OLD: X -[aux:*]-> Y is not supported anymore
  ==> new_syntax for regular expression on featues:
      NEW: X.feat = re"__your_regular_expression_here__" (no whitespace between re and double quote)
      OLD: X.feat == "__your_regular_expression_here__" introduced in 0.32 is not supported anymore
  --> remove lex_rule keyword: use "rule" instead
  --> add_neighbour is now deprecated and new syntax is introduced for nodes creation:
      add_node X        Create a new node named X wihtout position constraint
      add_node X :> Y   Create a new node named X immediatly after Y
      add_node X :> Y   Create a new node named X immediatly before Y
  * improve search for a sequence:
      1) search for the sequence with the requested name
      2) search for the module with the requested name
      3) select the first sequence defined in the GRS file
  * domain can be declared in a external file
  * add functions Rewrite.set_max_depth_non_det and Rewrite.set_max_depth_det to the library
  * improve error handling
  * change precedence implementation
  * remove useless code

Version 0.33.1 (2016/03/14)
  * fix Conll error locations

Version 0.33 (2016/03/11)
  * Fix implicit nodes handling with matching item with regexp: N.lemma == "a.*er"
  * move conll handling code into an external library libcaml-conll

Version 0.32 (2016/02/01)
  * extend syntax:
    - syntactic sugar: "A < B" is interpreted as "A.position < B.position"
    - complete pattern with implicit nodes
    - add new constraint with regexp
  * move to ocamlbuild
  * add "node_matching" function for the new "grep" mode

Version 0.31 (2015/11/15)
  * take ranges into account in conlls (UD)
  * Code reorganisation

Version 0.30 (2015/09/25)
  * Internal changes (adapt to new version of libcaml-dep2pict)

Version 0.29 (2015/08/28)
  * renumbering of conll output
  * ignore UDT lines with "i-j" number in UDT Conll

Version 0.28 (2015/08/12)
  * Add inequality constraints between numerical features and constants

Version 0.27
  * add syntax for inequality on features

Version 0.26 (2015/04/23)
  * The shift command can be parametrized by edge constraints
  * Negative edge constraint are available in out-edge (N -[^mod]-> *) and in-edge (* -[^mod]-> N) constraints

Version 0.25 (2015/04/08)
  * add support for the [-full] mode
  * handling of "*" in pattern edge labels

Version 0.24 (2014/11/24)
  * Changes in the interface:
    - the "loc" type is abstract and exported (changes the libgrew interface)
  * New features:
    - use a float in a command "node.feat = 123.456"
    - improve checking for consistency between rules and feature domain at GRS loading time
    - add the possibility to use parameters in the without part
  * Bug fixes:
    - take the feature "position" into account when the user chose features to display
    - accept colors like "#abc"
  * Misc
    - add files for Geshi
    - code reorganization
    - add activate mechanism (untested)
