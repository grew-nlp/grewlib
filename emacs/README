== Installation of the grew emacs mode ==

The grew emacs mode is defined in the file grew.el. You should put this file in a directory that emacs kowns, for instance:

  mkdir -p ~/.emacs.d         # Make the directory unless it exists
  mv grew.el ~/.emacs.d/      # Move grew.el into that directory

To install the grew mode for emacs put the lines below in some emacs init file (like ~/.emacs) 

  ;; mode pour grew
  (load-file "~/.emacs.d/grew.el")
  (setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.gr[s]?$" . grew-mode) auto-mode-alist))
  (autoload 'grew-mode "grew" "Major mode for editing grew files." t)
